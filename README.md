# CodeRed
First Gaming Project
So for anyone actually working on this project with me its purely in python 3
Its gonna be a basic text based rpg time combat game
Yes, im the only one working on this and no, im not a pro
Plan on releasing to a paid domain???
Possibly! I want to at somepoint to release this game to Steam honestly if I can
I want to think my partner in helping me be more motivated to write more and more code.
Also my viewers of my Broken Controllers channel on YouTube as well!
